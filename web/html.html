        <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages.<br>
        HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
        <p style="margin-top : 20px;">HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects, 
        such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. <br>
        It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. <br>
        HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>
